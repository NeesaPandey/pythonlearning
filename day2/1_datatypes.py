#DATATYPES

#1. Numbers
#2. Boolean
#3. List
#4. Tuples
#5. String
#6. Dictionary
#7. Set
 #except numbers and boolean,others types in python are sequential

 ###MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE OBJECTS ###
 # if an object once created can be altered in its life period then it is mutable
 #eg: list,dictionary,set
 #cant be altered - immutable
 #eg: int,float,boolean .tuple

#1. Numbers-Immu
#2. Boolean-Immu
#3. List-MU
#4. Tuples-Imm
#5. String-Immu
#6. Dictionary-MU
#7. Set-Mu

#immutable objects are faster than mutable to accessed
