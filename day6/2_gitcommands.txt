  11. git remote add origin <ssh-link>
     adds a remote with name 'origin' in the local repo

  12. git push -u origin main
    git push : uploaad your code to github
    -u : this tracks your local branch upstream with remote

  significance of -u (tracking the updtream) is that we can write "git push" only from next time
  onward. otherwise we should write "git push origin main" everytime"
