Version control
There are different version of the same project which should be backward compatible
These different versions of the same projects is maintained  by version control system
There are different version control system like git, mercurial etc .Git is famous one

why touse a version control system ?
to maintain project version efficiently and with less manual work
for team collaboration

the project maintained with version control system is later uploaded somewhere in the cloud
cloud storage like google drive, one drive, s3 .
these storage system do not cooperate with version control ( eg git)
so we should use such cloud services which understand version control . like : github, gitlab, bitbucket etc
